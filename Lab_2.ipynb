This particular deviation is represented by a Spine graph where it splits the amount of points scored on that specific day of the week into winning and losing categories with emphases variation using a fixed point of 0. Based off of the graph, we can see that there are obviously more points on the winning side because that is what makes it a win, but that can be seen as represented by the scale of points being a little greater for the win side. The colors make the graph easy to read since red is associated with losing and green is associated with winning. "
